# Password-Generator
a customizable password-generator



this week I modified starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected

when asked they have to choose length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

then they confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.


i did this by making the arrays into variables then using if functions to set which arrays to pull from.

I made a for loop to generate the number of character and which arrays to pull from. this is  bascially a randomizer.  kinda neat
